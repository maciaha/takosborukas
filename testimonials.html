				<span>Incredible! Legitimately the best Mexican food I've had in years!</span><br /><span>I've lived all over California, and Arizona, so I have eaten a lot of really good Mexican food, but this ranks amongst the best. The salsa was really good, the Al pastor was exactly what I was looking for, and I definitely will be back for more.</span><br /><span>Didn't have time to take a picture because I got one look at my torta and couldn't help myself.</span> <span>My compliments to the chef, owner and everyone working there. My family and I are going to be back soon. If you're still reading this, then stop and go try some, you won't be disappointed.</span>

				A friend recommend Takos Borukas for lunch. We went with s group of six. We sat right down and had drinks within a minute or two. The menu was deep with quality options. The service was fast and friendly. They didn't mind modifying any item, and the food was top notch. When you consider the price of $10-$13 a plate, this place was excellent. I highly recommend it.
